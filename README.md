# 2023_MazeProject_MotorCode

######## 2024 Nov update #########

This was the motor code I wrote for our maze solving system. The whole system (Power, Image Processing, Electromagnet and UI) were programmed on Raspberry Pi 4B.

I added some comments to give a clearer view of what each part of the code was doing.
